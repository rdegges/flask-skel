# flask-skel

An opinionated Flask project skeleton.


## Meta

## Purpose

This project is designed to make building Flask projects simple and
straightforward.  As a Flask user, I often want to write simple applications
quickly without the going through the typical application bootstrapping
process.

This project allows you to easily build Flask apps without sacrificing
maintainability.


## Features

This is what `flask-skel` can do for you:

* Basic (nothing fancy is going on here).
* Intuitive (it's really easy to see where you should put code).
* Deployable (you can deploy your Flask app locally or on Heroku easily).
* Testable (you can easily run unit tests against your Flask app).


## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, simply send a pull request to the
`master` branch.

Please keep your code style consistent with the rest of the project:

* PEP-8.
* Comments where necessary.
* Single quotes for strings.

Also: since this is a project skeleton, the core purpose is to provide a useful
base project, without any cruft. This means pull requests adding features that
are only useful for certain types of applications will be rejected. Keep things
simple and generic :)
