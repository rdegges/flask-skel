## Purpose

This project is designed to make building Flask projects simple and
straightforward. As a Flask user, I often want to write simple applications
quickly without the going through the typical application bootstrapping
process.

This projet allows you to easily build Flask apps without sacrificing
maintainability.


## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to the project, simply send a pull request to the
``master`` branch.

Please keep your code style consistent with the rest of the project:

* PEP-8.
* Comments where necessary.
* Single quotes for strings.

Also: since this is a project skeleton, the core purpose is to provide a useful
base project, without any cruft. This means pull requests adding features that
are only useful for certain types of applications will be rejected. Keep things
simple and generic :)
